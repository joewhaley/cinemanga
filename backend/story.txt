STORYBOARD PANELS - SCENE 1

PANEL 1 - ESTABLISHING SHOT
Wide shot of a dawn beach. Gray-blue early morning light. Violent ocean waves crashing onto wet sand. A bearded man in tattered, soaked clothing lies motionless face-down on the beach where the waves have deposited him. Foam and seaweed around his body. Atmospheric, moody lighting with heavy clouds.

PANEL 2 - MEDIUM SHOT
The bearded man slowly lifting his head from the sand, sand stuck to his wet face and beard. His eyes squinting, looking toward something off-frame. Expression of confusion and exhaustion. Dawn light on his weathered face.

PANEL 3 - POINT OF VIEW SHOT
From the bearded man's perspective lying on sand: A small blonde boy (approximately 5-6 years old) crouching with his back to camera, watching ocean waves destroy a sandcastle. A blonde girl of similar age joins him. Both children shown from behind only, faces not visible. Soft, dreamlike quality to the image.

PANEL 4 - MEDIUM SHOT
The two blonde children running away down the beach, still shot from behind, their faces never shown. The bearded man's arm reaching out weakly toward them before he collapses back onto the sand.

PANEL 5 - LOW ANGLE CLOSE-UP
Looking up from the bearded man's perspective: A rifle barrel in the foreground pointing down at camera. A Japanese security guard in modern uniform looking down sternly, silhouetted against the dawn sky.

PANEL 6 - WIDE ESTABLISHING SHOT
The beach scene from a new angle showing: the bearded man on the sand, one guard standing over him, another guard leaning against a military-style jeep. Behind them, a tall cliff face, and atop the cliff, a traditional Japanese castle with distinctive curved rooflines. Dawn lighting.

PANEL 7 - INTERIOR, MEDIUM SHOT
Elegant Japanese dining room with traditional and modern elements. A security guard stands at attention. An attendant in formal attire leans toward an elderly Japanese man (shown from behind) seated at a polished dining table. Warm interior lighting, expensive d√©cor visible.

The dining room with the elderly man at one end of the long table, the bearded man (now seated) at the other end, hungrily eating from a bowl. Guards visible in background.
